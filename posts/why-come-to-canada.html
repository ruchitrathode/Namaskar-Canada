    <h1>Why Come to Canada as an Indian Student? Pros & Cons</h1>
    <img src="../images/indian-student-canada.jpg" alt="Indian Student in Canada">

    <h2>The Dream Many Share</h2>
    <p>
      Canada has become a <span class="highlight">top destination for Indian students</span>—but why? Imagine walking into your first class and hearing multiple accents, feeling the chill in the air, and knowing you’ve started a brand new chapter. For many of us, it’s not just about education, it’s about <span class="highlight">a better future, exposure, and a lifestyle upgrade</span>.
    </p>

    <div class="tip-box">
      If you’re coming here only because your friend is, take a pause. Think about your long-term goals.
    </div>

    <h2>Pros: What Makes Canada Worth It?</h2>
    <ul>
      &nbsp;<li><strong>🎓 Quality Education:</strong> Canadian universities like UofT, UBC, and McGill are globally respected.</li>
      <li><strong>🧳 Pathway to PR:</strong> Study → Work Permit → PR is more straightforward compared to the US or UK.</li>
      <li><strong>🌍 Cultural Diversity:</strong> You’ll find friends from Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, even Nigeria and the Philippines!</li>
      <li><strong>💼 Work Opportunities:</strong> 20 hours/week part-time jobs + 3 years PGWP = strong ROI on your tuition.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="bonus-box">
      Canada’s healthcare system is free (for PRs and sometimes students). This can save you thousands!
    </div>

    <h2>Cons: The Side You Shouldn't Ignore</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>❄️ Extreme Winters:</strong> Be ready to face -20°C with snow storms. Invest in good boots and jackets.</li>
      <li><strong>🏡 High Living Costs:</strong> Rent, groceries, and transportation can cost CAD 800–1500/month.</li>
      <li><strong>🧠 Mental Pressure:</strong> Balancing part-time work, studies, and home sickness is not easy.</li>
      <li><strong> Racism Exists:</strong> Rare but real. Prepare mentally and stay strong. “Sab theek ho jaayega.”</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="caution-box">
      Don’t blindly join any college. Research DLI number, job opportunities, location, and reviews.
    </div>

    <h2>🎯 Who Should Actually Come?</h2>
    <p>
      Not everyone needs to come to Canada. You should consider it if:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You want global exposure and education</li>
      <li>You’re financially stable or have a loan plan in place</li>
      <li>You’re okay with working hard and sacrificing comfort for a few years</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tip-box">
      Do a 6-month self-assessment. Live on a strict budget in India, work part-time, and manage studies before deciding.
    </div>

    <h2>📌 Things Nobody Tells You</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Many part-time jobs are minimum wage and physically demanding (e.g., warehouse or Tim Hortons).</li>
      <li>You may have to live with 5–6 roommates to save on rent.</li>
      <li>Success doesn’t happen in 2 months—expect 2–3 years of hustle.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="bonus-box">
      Your soft skills—like communication, attitude, and discipline—matter *a lot* in Canada.
    </div>

    <h2>📝 What I'd Tell My Younger Brother</h2>
    <p>
      If I had a younger brother asking me, I'd say: “<strong>Bhai, Canada is amazing</strong>, but only if you're coming with the right mindset. This is not a shortcut to a luxury life—it’s a long but rewarding path. You’ll learn independence, confidence, and global thinking here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Come to Canada not to run away from India, but to <strong>grow into a better version of yourself</strong>.
    </p>
